## Hiwashi 6
1587 tons. 216k eggs.

- -20 tons lighter than hiwashi 5.
- added 6 inline bays, removed 6 bays on side (==weight diff)
- 492km/s now top speed. (+0.4km/s)
- cut 250MW power (down 750MW -> 500MW); unused, some accumulators to even out
- cut 2 rocket beacons (3.4k/m peak production now)
- cut some turrets around center
- circuit layout tweaks

## Hiwashi 5

1607 tons. 215k eggs.
**the one from the youtube video**.

- 6 tiles shorter in height than hiwashi 4
- moved venting up to the top. had to shift mid-section a little to the left
- extra weight reduction around carbonic
- lower quality turrets for less particle action and less duplicate targeting.

## Hiwashi 4
1614 tons

- carbonic minor improvements.

## Hiwashi 3
1640 tons. ~210k eggs.

- DI carbonic + smelting. clocked collectors.
- astroid scaled for astroid prod 30. add beacons on ice if lower.
- speculative early load with prom, aborts if not researching

## Hiwashi 2
1800ish tons. 205k eggs.

- dropped central sushi belt
- closer venting (underneath)
- minimised carbonic site for EXPL31 and dropped lasers

## Hiwashi 1
~2000 tons. ~200k eggs.

- side spoilers (holes) for aerodynamic efficiency (less weight => more speed)
- documented all combinators

## Hiwashi 0
~2150 tons. ~193k eggs.
Basically Hobbit's 3-grab Pella but with;

- 3 extra grabbers on each side to supplement early gathering.
- token system shifted to fulgora/nauvis for less wait time.
- removes lasers

Uses horrible weaving were the lasers were to get nuclear fuel in place and the new belt of prom.
Bumped tick time by 40s and added bonus egg cycle.
