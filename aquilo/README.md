# Aquilo Blades

aquilo blueprints designed and benchmarked for 8 belts of prom science using q2 cryogenic.
q2 holmium prerequisite (assumed to come from something like the [fulgora islands](../fulgora)).

## [Quantum 6.0](./quantum-v6.txt)

The quantum car blade from the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCnDNrBy8-0).

## [Cryo 6.0](./cryo-v6.txt)

q2 cryo blade 240/s.

cryo blade instructions;

- place, connect belts,
- distribute rocketfuel so that it can self-insert from belts once it's thawed
- place central tick networks for ice upcycling (28 tick to green, 65 tick to red)
- place central tick network for science output
- if ice jammed initially, empty all the left cars.

## [Aquilo Center 6.0](./aquilo-v6.txt)

centralised fluids for around ~6x blades.
