# 8 belt Hub

Hub scaled for the equivalent of 8 full green belts (8*240 science /s) pulling the 5 space sciences.

Expects;

- Q2 Cryo/Metallurgic
- Q1 Electro (but can be retrofitted for Q2)
- Q1 Agri/Promethean (hard to change as it's near the hub)

Includes a calcite export train, a belt dedicated to bioflux + promethean token.

There's also an emergency half belt for spoilage, but this shouldn't happen if you crush unused agri post-labs.
