# Nauvis

Common quality Nauvis science setups.

- Focus on multiples of 4 belts.
- Generally pretty compact
- Generally somewhat inserter clocked.

probably not amazingly performant; went for "compactness with a side of inserter clocking",
but it's not the part of the base that takes up the most UPS.

## [Nauvis2.0](./nauvis2.txt)

Release from july 19th.
