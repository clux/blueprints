## [Train Island 3.0](./fulgora-train3.txt)

- 240.4 q2 em science / s
- 4.75k q2 holm / m (250/m excess for exports)
- 59 recyclers
- 4 quality miners
- 5 sorting silos per quadrant
- 124k q1 scrap / m
- 37k q2 scrap / m
- 8000 cars / hour
- Train setup; 6s wait + 5s wait

### Notes on operating
I didn't do multi-stage blueprints for this so some things can be set-up wrong on initial plant;

1. If science is blocked, replant beacon next to the tank
2. If center-south Q5 scrap inserter is looping scrap on the belt, replant belt to make the inserter target the tank

Additionally, some users reported microstarvations over extremely long periods with 11s train wait. You may need to set 10s (5+5).
